Time of copying with default DBUF_SIZE=1024 (1KB)
real	0m6.077s
user	0m0.288s
sys	0m4.313s


Time of copying with DBUF_SIZE=64 parameter.
real	0m52.599s
user	0m4.116s
sys	0m46.956s
So, execution time was increased by several times. It is caused by more frequently appeals 
to the copy file which takes more time compared to writing the blocks of the original file to the memory buffer.  


Time of copying with default DBUF_SIZE=1024 and O_SYNC reading mode.
real	14m14.345s
user	0m0.502s
sys	0m32.597s
Time was increased enormously. Because of synchronization to complete copying iteration (every 1 KB) 
system has to fill the buffer or meet the end of file. Then the system writes the entire buffer to the copy file, 
it cannot continue to read original one until the end of that process. And due to long copy file access, 
the system has to wait too much time.
