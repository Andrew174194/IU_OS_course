Program 1 output:

Program 2 output:

So, as we can see, without "\n" string is saved in the buffer which is copied to new process.
Since string ends with "\n", buffer is written simulteniously before fork() is coming 
and no string copy goes to new process.
Since that we can assume that printf() is linebuffered output stream.
