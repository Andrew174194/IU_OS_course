Program 1 output:
Hello

Program 2 output:
Hello


So, as we can see, without "\n" string is saved in the buffer which is copied to a new process.
Since string ends with "\n", the buffer is written immediately before fork() is coming 
and no string copy goes to a new process.
Since that we can assume that printf() is a line-buffered output stream.
