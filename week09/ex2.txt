Miss ratio depends on how often the same pages occur and how close to each other they are.
If some page will occur with a big amount of time, it is more likely to be missed (page fault) no matter buffer's size.
On the other hand, if some pages will occur often enough and their amount will be less than the buffer's size, the hit count
will grow faster than miss one because of the high priority to occupy the buffer's places for such pages.

Lab input data results are:

100: 93/907
